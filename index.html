        <h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there, tinyRick here. I'm a college student studying Computer Science and a future U.S. Army soldier. (Note: All views expressed here are my own and do not represent any official entity.)</p>
        <p>This blog is where I share what I’ve learned and explore topics I’m passionate about. My main interests lie in cybersecurity—particularly in exploitation, post-exploitation tool development, and red teaming. Here, you’ll find write-ups on system internals, CTF challenges, vulnerable machines, technical breakdowns of techniques, CVE recreations, and hopefully, original research and findings as well.</p>
